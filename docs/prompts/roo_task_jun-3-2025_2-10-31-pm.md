**User:**

<task>
I need to create a simple scoring script in python for a self-assessment questionnaire, which will be presented by google forms.

The sample questions are in 'sample_data/Question-set.csv' (see below for file content) and sample  responses are in 'sample_data/respones.csv' (see below for file content) 

The question set columns labeled L1-L4 are the answers for the corresponding maturity level.

The scoring should be grouped by the category column and the maturity levels are 1-4 (L1, is 1, for example) and 4 is the highest score. 

The responses are given on a single line with columns for each of the questions with the text of the answer so the scoring will need to map the text answer to a numbered score.

Keep the script simple and for each response line output the timestamp and the score for each category.
</task>

**Assistant:**

Now let me analyze the CSV files more carefully to understand the data structure and requirements.

<thinking>
Looking at the Question-set.csv:
- It has columns: Category, Question, L1, L2, L3, L4
- L1-L4 represent the answer options for each maturity level
- There are some duplicate/original rows that seem to be variations

Looking at the responses.csv:
- It has columns for: Timestamp, Score (empty), and then one column for each question
- The responses contain the actual text of the answer selected

The task is to:
1. Map the text answers to maturity level scores (1-4)
2. Group scores by category
3. Output timestamp and score for each category

Key challenges:
- Need to match question text between the two files
- Need to match answer text to the appropriate L1-L4 level
- Need to handle the variations in questions (ORIGINAL versions)
- Need to group by category and calculate scores
</thinking>

Based on my analysis of the files and requirements, I'll create a detailed plan for the scoring script.

## Scoring Script Plan

### Overview
The scoring script will process Google Forms responses and calculate maturity scores for each category based on a predefined question set with maturity levels (L1-L4).

### Key Components

#### 1. Data Loading
- Load question set from `sample_data/Question-set.csv`
- Load responses from `sample_data/respones.csv`
- Handle CSV parsing with proper error handling

#### 2. Data Structures
- **Question Mapping**: Dictionary mapping question text to its category and maturity level answers
- **Score Mapping**: Dictionary to map answer text to maturity level (1-4)

#### 3. Processing Logic

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Load Question Set] --> B[Build Question-Category Map]
    B --> C[Build Answer-Score Map]
    D[Load Responses] --> E[Process Each Response]
    E --> F[Match Questions to Categories]
    F --> G[Map Answers to Scores]
    G --> H[Group Scores by Category]
    H --> I[Output Results]
    C --> E
```

#### 4. Implementation Details

1. **Question Matching Strategy**:
   - Strip whitespace and normalize question text
   - Handle variations (e.g., questions with "(ORIGINAL)" suffix)
   - Use partial matching if exact match fails

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each response row:
     - Match each answer to its corresponding question
     - Find which maturity level (L1-L4) the answer belongs to
     - Assign score (L1=1, L2=2, L3=3, L4=4)
     - Group scores by category
     - Calculate average score per category

3. **Output Format**:
   ```
   Timestamp: 5/27/2025 11:46:07
   Investment: 3.5
   Adoption: 2.8
   Interfaces: 2.0
   Operations: 4.0
   Measurement: 2.3
   ```

#### 5. Error Handling
- Handle missing questions or categories
- Handle unmatched answers (assign score of 0 or skip)
- Log warnings for data inconsistencies

#### 6. Script Structure
```python
# scoring.py
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

def load_questions(filepath):
    # Load and parse question set
    
def load_responses(filepath):
    # Load and parse responses
    
def build_question_map(questions):
    # Create mapping of questions to categories and answers
    
def calculate_scores(response, question_map):
    # Calculate scores for one response
    
def main():
    # Main processing logic
```

### Questions for Clarification

**Assistant:**

Now I have all the information needed. Let me create a comprehensive plan for the scoring script.

## Final Scoring Script Plan

### Project Structure
```
pemm-assessment-scoring/
├── scoring.py          # Main scoring script
├── sample_data/
│   ├── Question-set.csv
│   └── respones.csv
└── output/            # Directory for output files (optional)
```

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### 1. **Core Functionality**

```python
# scoring.py structure

import csv
import logging
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class AssessmentScorer:
    def __init__(self, questions_file: str, responses_file: str):
        self.questions_file = questions_file
        self.responses_file = responses_file
        self.question_map = {}
        self.category_map = {}
        
    def load_questions(self) -> Dict:
        """Load questions and build mappings"""
        
    def load_responses(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Load response data"""
        
    def find_maturity_level(self, answer: str, maturity_options: Dict) -> int:
        """Match answer text to maturity level"""
        
    def score_response(self, response: Dict) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate scores for a single response"""
        
    def process_all_responses(self):
        """Main processing loop"""
        
def main():
    scorer = AssessmentScorer(
        'sample_data/Question-set.csv',
        'sample_data/respones.csv'
    )
    scorer.process_all_responses()
```

#### 2. **Key Processing Steps**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Load Question Set]
    B --> C{Filter ORIGINAL questions}
    C --> D[Build Question-Category Mapping]
    D --> E[Build Answer-Score Mapping]
    E --> F[Load Responses]
    F --> G[For Each Response]
    G --> H[Match Question Headers]
    H --> I[Map Answers to Scores]
    I --> J{Answer Found?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Add to Category Score]
    J -->|No| L[Log Notice & Skip]
    K --> M[Calculate Category Averages]
    L --> M
    M --> N[Output Results]
    N --> O{More Responses?}
    O -->|Yes| G
    O -->|No| P[End]
```

#### 3. **Data Processing Logic**

1. **Question Loading**:
   - Skip rows with "(ORIGINAL)" in the question
   - Skip rows with empty questions
   - Create mapping: `question_text -> (category, {L1: answer1, L2: answer2, ...})`

2. **Response Processing**:
   - For each response row:
     - Extract timestamp
     - For each question column (skip Timestamp and Score):
       - Find matching question in question_map
       - Determine which maturity level the answer matches
       - Add score to category accumulator
     - Calculate average score per category
     - Output results

3. **Answer Matching**:
   - Exact string matching (case-insensitive)
   - Strip whitespace
   - If no match found, log notice and skip

#### 4. **Output Format**

```
Timestamp: 5/27/2025 11:46:07
Investment: 2.75
Adoption: 2.67
Interfaces: 2.50
Operations: 4.00
Measurement: 2.25

Timestamp: 6/2/2025 2:44:52
Investment: 1.50
Adoption: 2.00
Interfaces: 1.00
Operations: 1.00
Measurement: 2.33
```

#### 5. **Error Handling & Logging**

- Log notices for:
  - Unmatched answers
  - Questions not found in question set
  - Empty categories
- Continue processing despite errors
- Summary at end showing total processed and any issues

#### 6. **Future Enhancements** (not in initial version)
- CSV output option
- Fuzzy matching for answers
- Visualization of scores
- Batch processing multiple response files
- Configuration file for scoring rules

# PEMM Assessment Scoring Script Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a Python script that scores self-assessment questionnaire responses from Google Forms. The scoring system maps text answers to maturity levels (1-4) and calculates average scores by category.

## Requirements
- Process questionnaire responses from CSV files
- Map text answers to numeric maturity scores (L1=1, L2=2, L3=3, L4=4)
- Group scores by category
- Output timestamp and average score for each category
- Handle unmatched answers by skipping and logging
- Skip questions marked as "(ORIGINAL)"
- Handle empty question rows gracefully

## Data Files
- **Question Set**: `sample_data/Question-set.csv`
  - Contains categories, questions, and answer options for each maturity level (L1-L4)
- **Responses**: `sample_data/respones.csv`
  - Contains timestamps and text answers for each question

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

```python
# scoring.py structure

import csv
import logging
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

class AssessmentScorer:
    def __init__(self, questions_file: str, responses_file: str):
        self.questions_file = questions_file
        self.responses_file = responses_file
        self.question_map = {}
        self.category_map = {}
        
    def load_questions(self) -> Dict:
        """Load questions and build mappings"""
        
    def load_responses(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Load response data"""
        
    def find_maturity_level(self, answer: str, maturity_options: Dict) -> int:
        """Match answer text to maturity level"""
        
    def score_response(self, response: Dict) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Calculate scores for a single response"""
        
    def process_all_responses(self):
        """Main processing loop"""
```

### Processing Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Load Question Set]
    B --> C{Filter ORIGINAL questions}
    C --> D[Build Question-Category Mapping]
    D --> E[Build Answer-Score Mapping]
    E --> F[Load Responses]
    F --> G[For Each Response]
    G --> H[Match Question Headers]
    H --> I[Map Answers to Scores]
    I --> J{Answer Found?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Add to Category Score]
    J -->|No| L[Log Notice & Skip]
    K --> M[Calculate Category Averages]
    L --> M
    M --> N[Output Results]
    N --> O{More Responses?}
    O -->|Yes| G
    O -->|No| P[End]
```

## Key Processing Rules

1. **Question Filtering**:
   - Skip rows containing "(ORIGINAL)" in the question text
   - Include rows with empty questions but skip them during scoring if no answer provided
   - Build a mapping of question text to category and maturity level answers

2. **Answer Matching**:
   - Use case-insensitive exact string matching
   - Strip whitespace from both questions and answers
   - If no match is found, log a notice and skip the question (don't include in average)

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - L1 answer = score of 1
   - L2 answer = score of 2  
   - L3 answer = score of 3
   - L4 answer = score of 4
   - Calculate average score per category (sum of scores / number of answered questions)

4. **Output Format**:
   ```
   Timestamp: 5/27/2025 11:46:07
   Investment: 2.75
   Adoption: 2.67
   Interfaces: 2.50
   Operations: 4.00
   Measurement: 2.25
   ```

## Error Handling

- Log notices for:
  - Unmatched answers (answer text doesn't match any L1-L4 option)
  - Questions in responses that aren't in the question set
  - Empty categories (no valid scores)
- Continue processing despite errors
- Provide summary at end showing:
  - Total responses processed
  - Number of unmatched answers
  - Any other issues encountered

## Usage

```bash
python scoring.py
```

The script will:
1. Read question set from `sample_data/Question-set.csv`
2. Read responses from `sample_data/respones.csv`
3. Process and score each response
4. Output results to console

## Future Enhancements (not in initial version)
- Command-line arguments for input/output files
- CSV output option for easier data analysis
- Fuzzy matching for answer text
- Visualization of maturity scores
- Batch processing of multiple response files
- Configuration file for custom scoring rules
- Web interface for uploading and processing files

**Assistant:**

The Python script `scoring.py` has been created and executed successfully. It processes the questions and responses from the provided CSV files, calculates the average maturity score for each category per response, and prints the results to the console.

The script correctly:
*   Loads questions from [`sample_data/Question-set.csv`](sample_data/Question-set.csv:1) and responses from [`sample_data/respones.csv`](sample_data/respones.csv:1).
*   Skips questions that do not have defined L1-L4 answers (e.g., "How does your organization support platform adoption?").
*   Outputs the timestamp and average scores for each category for both sample responses.
*   Provides a summary of processed responses and any unmatched answers.

The output matches the requested format.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I understand. You'd like to make the script more flexible by allowing the question set and response file paths to be specified as command-line arguments.

I will delegate this modification to the Code mode.

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
The user wants to update the existing `scoring.py` script to accept command-line arguments for the input file paths.

Please perform the following modifications:
1.  Import the `argparse` module.
2.  In the `main()` function, set up an `ArgumentParser`.
3.  Define two required command-line arguments:
    *   `--questions` (short form `-q`): For the path to the question set CSV file. Add help text: "Path to the question set CSV file."
    *   `--responses` (short form `-r`): For the path to the responses CSV file. Add help text: "Path to the responses CSV file."
4.  Parse these arguments in the `main()` function.
5.  Modify the instantiation of the `AssessmentScorer` class in `main()` to use the file paths provided by these command-line arguments instead of the current hardcoded paths.
6.  Ensure the script maintains its existing functionality when the correct file paths are provided via these new CLI arguments.
7.  After implementing these changes, use the `attempt_completion` tool. In the `result` parameter, provide a summary of the modifications made to `scoring.py`, confirming that CLI arguments for question and response files have been added. For the `command` parameter, provide an example command to run the script with the sample data files: `python scoring.py -q sample_data/Question-set.csv -r sample_data/respones.csv`.

This subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions. These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions your mode might have.

    *   `--responses` (short form `-r`): For the path to the responses CSV file. Add help text: "Path to the responses CSV file."
4.  Parse these arguments in the `main()` function.
5.  Modify the instantiation of the `AssessmentScorer` class in `main()` to use the file paths provided by these command-line arguments instead of the current hardcoded paths.
6.  Ensure the script maintains its existing functionality when the correct file paths are provided via these new CLI arguments.
7.  After implementing these changes, use the `attempt_completion` tool. In the `result` parameter, provide a summary of the modifications made to `scoring.py`, confirming that CLI arguments for question and response files have been added. For the `command` parameter, provide an example command to run the script with the sample data files: `python scoring.py -q sample_data/Question-set.csv -r sample_data/respones.csv`.

**Assistant:**

The `scoring.py` script has been successfully updated by the Code mode to include command-line arguments for specifying the question set and response file paths.

This completes the requested enhancements. You can now run the script with custom file paths.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
The Python scoring script (`scoring.py`) has been created and enhanced to accept command-line arguments for the question set (`-q` or `--questions`) and response (`-r` or `--responses`) CSV files. The script calculates and displays the average maturity scores per category for each response.
</result>
<command>python scoring.py -q sample_data/Question-set.csv -r sample_data/respones.csv</command>
