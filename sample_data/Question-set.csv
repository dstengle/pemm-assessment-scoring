Operations,,,,,
Operations (ORIGINAL),"What is the approach to delivery and support of functionality/capabilities by the platform engineering teams, including day2 updates & maintenance.","The teams involved in the delivery of the capability have an informal approach to supporting others using the capability, typically with a reactive approach to updates based on events such as security incidents, bugs, new requirements.",Processes for planning and managing the lifecycle of capabilities is at least centrally defined or tracked but not applied by a central team.
